Triggers

Triggers are the SQL statements that are automatically executed when there is any event in the database.In response to certain events (INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE) in a particular table.
Tiggers are commonly used in SQL Server to automate data updates. 

Syntax:
create trigger Trigger_name
(before | after)
[insert | update | delete] 
on [table_name]  
[for each row]  
[trigger_body]

CREATE TRIGGER: These two keywords specify that a triggered block is going to be declared.
TRIGGER_NAME: It creates or replaces an existing trigger with the Trigger_name. The trigger name should be unique.
BEFORE | AFTER: It specifies when the trigger will be initiated i.e. before the ongoing event or after the ongoing event.
INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE : These are the DML operations and we can use either of them in a given trigger.
ON[TABLE_NAME]: It specifies the name of the table on which the trigger is going to be applied.
FOR EACH ROW: Row-level trigger gets executed when any row value of any column changes.
TRIGGER BODY: It consists of queries that need to be executed when the trigger is called.


create trigger set_marks before insert on student_det for each row
set new.Marks=new.Marks+100;

The new keyword refers to the row that is getting affected.
                    
insert into student_details values(106,"felix","Chris",22);

SELECT * FROM Student;

create table student_det(rollno int, fname varchar(255),lname varchar(255),Marks int);
mysql> create table student_det(rollno int, fname varchar(255),lname varchar(255),Marks int);
